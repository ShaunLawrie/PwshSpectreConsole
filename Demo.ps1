Write-SpectreParagraph "PwshSpectreConsole is an opinionated wrapper for the awesome Spectre.Console library. It's opinionated in that I have not just exposed the internals of Spectre Console to PowerShell but have wrapped them in a way that makes them work better in the PowerShell ecosystem (in my opinion ðŸ˜œ). Spectre Console is mostly an async library and it leans heavily on types and extension methods in C# which are very verbose to work with in PowerShell so this module hides away some of the complexity."
Write-SpectreParagraph "The module doesn't expose the full feature set of Spectre.Console because the scope of the library is huge and I've focused on the features that I use to enhance my scripts."

$example | Write-SpectreExample -Title "Text Entry" -Description "Text entry is essential for user input and interaction in a terminal application. It allows users to enter commands, input data, or provide search queries, giving them the ability to interact with the application and perform tasks. The built-in PowerShell Read-Host has some additional functionality like auto-complete and history that the Spectre text entry doesn't have so Read-Host is usually a better option for text entry in your scripts."

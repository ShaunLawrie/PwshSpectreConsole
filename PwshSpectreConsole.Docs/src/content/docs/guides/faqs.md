1. **What is Spectre Console?**  
Spectre Console is a .NET library to help people create really, really, ridiculously good-looking console applications in C# and other languages. See [https://spectreconsole.net/](https://spectreconsole.net/) for the original project.

2. **Why build PwshSpectreConsole?**  
The C# library uses a lot of language features that are not easily accessible in PowerShell so PwshSpectreConsole wraps the library to make it easier to use for the basic use-cases.

3. **Why is this not written in C#?**  
I wanted to see if I could do it in PowerShell and I think it's a fun project. I also wanted to see if I could make it easier to use for PowerShell users to contribute if they're not familiar with C#.

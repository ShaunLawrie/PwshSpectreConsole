1. **What is Spectre Console?**  
Spectre Console is a .NET library to help people create really, really, ridiculously good-looking console applications in C# and other languages. See [https://spectreconsole.net/](https://spectreconsole.net/) for the original project.

2. **Why build PwshSpectreConsole?**  
The original library uses a lot of C# features that are not easily accessible in PowerShell so PwshSpectreConsole wraps the library to make it easier to use for the basic use-cases. I also like to write a lot of PowerShell and find some of the PowerShell core library options a bit boring for my scripts.

3. **Why are there features missing?**  
This is a starting point, it covers the basics of the library and the most common use-cases. If you want to do something more advanced, you can use the [Spectre.Console](https://spectreconsole.net/) library directly for which there are lots of examples in the source code [for this repository on Github](https://github.com/ShaunLawrie/PwshSpectreConsole).

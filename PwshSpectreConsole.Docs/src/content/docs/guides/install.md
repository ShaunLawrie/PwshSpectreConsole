PwshSpectreConsole is a wrapper for the awesome [Spectre Console](https://spectreconsole.net/) which you can use to make your PowerShell scripts more interesting.

Install PwshSpectreConsole from PSGallery using the following command in your terminal (this requires PowerShell 7+):

```powershell
Install-Module PwshSpectreConsole -Scope CurrentUser
```

### ðŸ‘» Emoji Support and Line Drawing

With the default configuration Windows Terminal and the older console host don't support the full range of Spectre Console features. It will still work but you will find it doesn't look quite like all the examples.

To get the full feature set:

 1. Use Windows Terminal instead of the old console host.
 2. Install a NerdFont, a font with additional visual characters. I use "Cascadia Cove NF" from [https://www.nerdfonts.com/](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
 3. Enable full unicode by adding `$OutputEncoding = [console]::InputEncoding = [console]::OutputEncoding = New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding` as the **FIRST LINE** in your $PROFILE file.

### Description

This function uses Spectre Console to prompt the user with a question and returns the user's input.
:::caution
I would advise against this and instead use `Read-Host` because the Spectre Console prompt doesn't have access to the PowerShell session history.  
Without session history you can't use the up and down arrow keys to navigate through your previous commands.
This text entry also doesn't allow you to use arrow keys to go back and forwards through the text you're entering.

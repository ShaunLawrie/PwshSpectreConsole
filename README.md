PwshSpectreConsole is a wrapper for the [awesome Spectre.Console library](https://spectreconsole.net/).
Spectre Console is a dotnet library and it leans heavily on types and extension methods in C# which are very verbose to work with in PowerShell so this module hides away some of the complexity.  

The module has access to all features available in Spectre.Console.

## Installation
